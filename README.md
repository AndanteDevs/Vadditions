README
======

- Thank you for installing `Vadditions (Vanilla Additions)` into your Minecraft world!

Installation
------------

- Create a new world before installing `Vadditions`
  If you are installing `Vadditions` into an existing world, please be aware that this process is irreversible due to world generation mechanics.

- Click on `Source code (zip)` in the releases section of the Vadditions repository
- Unzip the downloaded file
- Move `Vadditions Resources` into your                 `resourcepacks` folder
- Move `Vadditions Data`      into your desired world's `datapacks` folder

Contributing
------------

- Want to help the Vadditions team develop the pack? The easiest way to do this is to contact Andante on either Discord `(Andante#7922)` or Twitter `(@Andantweets)`. There's also a Vadditions datapack discord server somewhere, though I can't find a link for that... strange. Oh yeah! It's on the wiki, `vadditions-datapack.wikia.com`
- We are in need of translators! See this text and think you could do it? Message me on Discord, `Andante#7922`!
- Anyone good at textures? Anyone? It'd be nice to have a 32x version of the Vadditions resources for the community to have, so if you'd like to do that message me on Discord with your finished result, `Andante#7922`!

Disclaimer
----------

- `Myself` or `I` is `Andante/Daniel Orr`, other references can be found after their respective longhand.

- I do NOT take credit for the models and/or textures of these custom entities:
	- White Castle Master `(WCM)`, created by Jragon014 `(J)` and used as 'Blight' `(B)` in The Tempests Box `(TTB`). Used in this pack as TTB is not yet, and probably won't be, out for a while due to 1.13 command changes.
	- Commands related to the WCM/B were created by J but converted and improved to the requirements of Vadditions `(V)` and the 1.13 command changes.
- I do NOT take credit for the majority of these modules' commands:
    - Structure generation `(SG)`, created by J, adapted for the 1.13 command changes by myself.
